## Step 4:

I log in to ieng6. It is not optimal, but I find that copying and pasting the password does not take too much time-- around 5 seconds or so.

## Step 5:

I clone the repository into my ieng6. I then type in `cd lab7`.

This takes 5 seconds as I already have the command on a text file. The typing takes another 4 seconds.


## Step 6: 

I demonstrated failure by running the test. Again, this takes roughly 5 seconds because it is already pasted on a text file.

## Step 7:
I go on vim and hit 'down' 43 times and hit 'right' 11 times. I then hit 'i', pressed 'delete', and hit '2'. I then typed in ':wq'. This takes a minute and ten seconds.

## Step 8: 

I run the test again by hitting 'up' twice and pressing 'enter'.

### Step 9:

I paste the commands:

`git add ListExamples.java`

`git commit -m "Fix index issue in merge method"`

`git push`

This takes 5 seconds because I already have it on text file.
